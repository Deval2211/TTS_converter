# TTS_converter

This project presents a web-based application that enables users to upload a multimedia file and input a custom text prompt, which is then processed using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) deep learning model hosted on Gradio (E2-F5-TTS). Built using Pythonâ€™s Flask framework and modern HTML/CSS for the frontend, the system provides an integrated experience of receiving audio, image, and text outputs.

The motivation behind this project was to explore real-world applications of artificial intelligence in the domains of speech synthesis, multimedia processing, and interactive web systems. The platform accepts a reference file and a text input, and in return, delivers synthesized speech, a generated image, and the transformed text output. This system demonstrates how modern AI models can be leveraged to create interactive and educational tools with practical implications in accessibility, content generation, and intelligent assistants.

The modular design of the application allows easy enhancement and scalability for future improvements, including support for other TTS models or natural language features.
